# Clustering Guardians Headlines

Performed unsupervised learning on data we collected from the Guardians Headline dataset. 

#### Requirements
You generate a new dataset from an online API or scraping. No pre-made datasets!

You are expected to be working on some form of TEXT DATA - and not just numerical data

You discover underlying clusters (social communities, market patterns, etc.) using unsupervised learning tools we've seen in class (clustering, dimensionality reduction, pre-trained word embeddings, network embedding, etc.)Produce a visualization in 2d or 3d of the data with the clusters you found tagged.

Analyze the produced clusters and use them to provide a short explanation of what you found.
